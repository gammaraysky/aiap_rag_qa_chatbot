 "
33,What if I decide to stop AIAP?,"As AIAP is a fully sponsored programme, if you withdraw from the programme, you will be required to reimburse AI Singapore for your monthly training allowance and program fees paid."
34,How much is the monthly stipend and how is the monthly training allowance determined?,"
The monthly training allowance or stipend value is calculated based on relevant experiences in AI, ML, Data-science, software engineering, associated software development and educational qualifications listed in your curricula vitae (CV) submitted when you applied for AIAP.
The monthly training allowance is between SGD 3500 – SGD 5500.
It is therefore important to indicate your education qualifications and your work experiences clearly in your CV. The monthly training allowance value offered is not negotiable. "
35,What is the monthly salary and how is the monthly training allowance determined?,"The monthly apprenticeship allowance or scholarship value is calculated based on relevant experience in the fields of AI, ML, data science, software development, related software development and educational qualifications detailed in your resume (CV) submitted when applying to AIAP.
The monthly apprenticeship allowance ranges from SGD 3500 – SGD 5500.
It is therefore important that you make your educational qualifications and work experience clear on your CV. The monthly training allowance offered is non-negotiable."
36,Why do I need to have 2 guarantors when I accept the AIAP admission offer?,"
AIAP is a fully sponsored programme by the Singapore government, hence AI Singapore requires all apprentices to have 2 working Singaporeans / Singapore Permanent Residents with minimum annual income of $30,000 as guarantors.
Guarantors will be responsible for the payback of the fees (sponsored by AISG and/or AISG’s funding partners) when there is a breach of the terms & conditions/trainee agreement and the apprentice is unable to pay back the fees. "
