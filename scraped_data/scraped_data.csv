1,How does an organisation apply for the 100 Experiments (100E)?,"
AISG will provide the templates for an organisation to submit a proposal.
The proposal will be evaluated on:

Is it an AI use case?
Does the proposed AI solution create substantial business value or impact for the organisation and its stakeholders (employees, customers, partners, investors, etc)?
Is a commercial off-the-shelf solution available?
Is the AI technology available to produce the outcomes that the organisation expects?
Can the AI model(s) be developed within 7 months or 18 to 24 months?
Are there relevant and sufficient annotated data to train the AI model(s)?

 
Only companies with IT/R&D/Engineering teams in Singapore will be considered. ",100E
2,What are my responsibilities as a Project Sponsor?,"
To ensure a successful outcome from the 100E project, Project Sponsors are expected to have the following:

A clear problem statement and objective
Active contribution from the 3 key roles (Product Owner, Project Lead, Technical Lead)
Be able to provide the required datasets and
Be able to take over the solution for integration and deployment
 ",100E
3,Can I have AI apprentices on my project?,"
AI apprentices will be assigned for all 7-month 100E-Industry project. 
AI apprentices together with the AISG project manager and AI engineer/mentor from the AISG engineering team are also made available to the PI for the 18 to 24-month 100E-Research project. ",100E

6,What if I decided to drop out of AIAP?,"









As AIAP is a fully sponsored programme, if you drop out of the programme, you will have to reimburse AI Singapore for the monthly training allowance that has been paid out to you and the programme fees.








 ",AI Apprencticeship Program (AIAP)
7,How much is the monthly stipend and how is the monthly training allowance determined?,"
The monthly training allowance or stipend value is calculated based on relevant experiences in AI, ML, Data-science, software engineering, associated software development and educational qualifications listed in your curricula vitae (CV) submitted when you applied for AIAP.
The monthly training allowance is between SGD 3500 – SGD 5500.
It is therefore important to indicate your education qualifications and your work experiences clearly in your CV. The monthly training allowance value offered is not negotiable. ",AI Apprencticeship Program (AIAP)
8,Why do I need to have 2 guarantors when I accept the AIAP admission offer?,"
AIAP is a fully sponsored programme by the Singapore government, hence AI Singapore requires all apprentices to have 2 working Singaporeans / Singapore Permanent Residents with minimum annual income of $30,000 as guarantors.
Guarantors will be responsible for the payback of the fees (sponsored by AISG and/or AISG’s funding partners) when there is a breach of the terms & conditions/trainee agreement and the apprentice is unable to pay back the fees. ",AI Apprencticeship Program (AIAP)
9,What AI tools and frameworks would the AIAP apprentices know?,"









Most of the projects done by the AIAP apprentices would be built in Python and using frameworks such as Tensorflow/Keras, PyTorch.
They would also have built their tools on platforms such as Microsoft Azure Cloud, Google Cloud, AWS and Spark/Databricks.
However, each apprentice would typically be proficient in more tools than those listed above, as they would be involved in different types of projects which require different types of tools and programmes.
