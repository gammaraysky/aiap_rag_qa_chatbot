"AISG will provide the templates for an organisation to submit a proposal. The proposal will be evaluated on:  Is it an AI use case? Does the proposed AI solution create substantial business value or impact for the organisation and its stakeholders (employees, customers, partners, investors, etc)? Is a commercial off-the-shelf solution available? Is the AI technology available to produce the outcomes that the organisation expects? Can the AI model(s) be developed within 7 months or 18 to 24 months? Are there relevant and sufficient annotated data to train the AI model(s)?    Only companies with IT/R&D/Engineering teams in Singapore will be considered."
